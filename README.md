# Disas2Dbg
Reverse engineers often need to run debugger and disassembler at the same time and need to convert virtual address one from another to add a quick breakpoint to hook the content. To make my and others like mes life easier I've created this small GUI tool. You just need to add same positional address of disassembler and debugger as base address. Then put the address you want to convert and press ENTER.
